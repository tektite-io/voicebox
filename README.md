## Why Voicebox?

Voice AI is exploding, but most tools are either cloud-locked, expensive, or a nightmare to set up. Voicebox is different:

- **100% Local** — Your voice data never leaves your machine
- **Lightweight** — No bloated Electron, native Tauri performance
- **Fast** — Near-instant on CUDA, optimized for Apple Silicon
- **Flexible** — Use the app, integrate the API, or both
- **Open Source** — No subscriptions, no limits, no lock-in

Built with **Tauri** (Rust), **TypeScript**, **React**, and **Python**. Native performance meets modern DX.

- **Import/Export** profiles to share or backup
- **Organize** with descriptions and language tags

### Speech Generation

- **Text-to-speech** with any cloned voice
- **Batch generation** for long-form content
- **Smart caching** — regenerate instantly with voice prompt caching

### Recording & Transcription

- **In-app recording** with waveform visualization
- **Automatic transcription** powered by Whisper
- **Export recordings** in multiple formats

### Generation History

- **Full history** of all generated audio
- **Search & filter** by voice, text, or date
- **Re-generate** any past generation with one click

### Flexible Deployment

- **Local mode** — Everything runs on your machine
- **Remote mode** — Connect to a GPU server on your network
- **One-click server** — Turn any machine into a Voicebox server

## API

Voicebox exposes a full REST API, so you can integrate voice synthesis into your own apps.

```bash
# Generate speech
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Hello world", "profile_id": "abc123"}'

# List voice profiles
curl http://localhost:8000/api/profiles

# Create a profile from audio
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/profiles \
  -F "audio=@voice-sample.wav" \
  -F "name=My Voice"
```

**Use cases:**

- Game dialogue systems
- Podcast/video production pipelines
- Accessibility tools
- Voice assistants
- Content creation automation

Full API documentation available at `http://localhost:8000/docs` when running.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Desktop App | Tauri (Rust) |
| Frontend | React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS |
| State | Zustand, React Query |
| Backend | FastAPI (Python) |
| Voice Model | Qwen3-TTS |
| Transcription | Whisper |
| Database | SQLite |
| Audio | WaveSurfer.js, librosa |

**Why this stack?**

- **Tauri over Electron** — 10x smaller bundle, native performance, lower memory
- **FastAPI** — Async Python with automatic OpenAPI schema generation
- **Type-safe end-to-end** — Generated TypeScript client from OpenAPI spec

---

## Roadmap

Voicebox is the beginning of something bigger. Here's what's coming:

### Coming Soon

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Real-time Synthesis** | Stream audio as it generates, word by word |
| **Conversation Mode** | Multi-speaker dialogues with automatic turn-taking |
| **Voice Effects** | Pitch shift, reverb, M3GAN-style effects |
| **Timeline Editor** | Audio studio with word-level precision editing |
| **More Models** | XTTS, Bark, and other open-source voice models |

### Future Vision

- **Voice Design** — Create new voices from text descriptions
- **Project System** — Save and load complex multi-voice sessions
- **Plugin Architecture** — Extend with custom models and effects
- **Mobile Companion** — Control Voicebox from your phone

Voicebox aims to be the **one-stop shop for everything voice** — cloning, synthesis, editing, effects, and beyond.
